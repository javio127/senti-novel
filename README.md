Novel Global Threat Predictor
Identify emerging risks using AI-driven analysis of real-time news data.

Overview
The Novel Global Threat Predictor is an AI-powered risk assessment tool that analyzes real-time news data to identify novel, underappreciated threats that could emerge between 2025-2035.

It processes unstructured news data, extracts key themes, and generates risk scenarios with probability and severity assessments using GPT-4 and BERTopic clustering.

How It Works
1. Data Collection
Sources: NewsData.io, GDELT Project
Scope: Scans real-time global news across various timeframes
Query Strategy: Uses AI to expand risk-related keywords and search perspectives
2. Data Processing
Embeddings: Converts text into numerical representations using OpenAIâ€™s embedding model
Clustering: Groups related articles using BERTopic (based on UMAP + HDBSCAN)
Topic Extraction: Identifies key themes and weak signals in global news
3. Risk Analysis
Scenario Generation: GPT-4 synthesizes a risk description based on clustered news themes
Probability Assessment: Calculates likelihood based on:
Trend Momentum, Barriers to Realization, Historical Analogues, Expert Discourse, Emerging Warning Signs
Severity Assessment: Estimates potential impact (fatalities) based on:
Direct Impact, Cascade Effects, Geographic Scope, Vulnerable Populations, Temporal Persistence
4. Output and Insights
Risk Scenario: Detailed description of a novel threat
Quantitative Assessment: Probability score (0.0-1.0) and estimated fatalities
Early Warning Indicators: Signals that suggest the risk is materializing
Visual Representation: AI-generated conceptual artwork of the threat
